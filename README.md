# Hugo theme for Sapienza website (new style)

This theme is a porting of the new template for Sapienza University websites.

![preview](example.png "Preview website")

All main sections below the header are taken from the first level of `main` menu. All subtrees are drawn in the left menu in the corresponding "section".

In the front-matter you can add a `pagemenu` key with an array of menus to be drawn in the index page (more examples soon).
